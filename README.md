**Challenge goal**: The goal of this challenge is for you to validate your knowledge of Router and Context API. The idea is to put all these concepts together to understand the benefits of using a global state on two views from one of our projects and help you to involve your code skills to the next level.

**Target level**: To tackle this challenge you must know how React works, Reach Router and Context API.

**Final accomplishment**: At the end of this challenge, you will be able to use the Context API, control form inputs states, and Routes. Also, you will have to build an application very similar to one of ours projects.
